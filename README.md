Laptop Monitor Toggle 🖥️
Welcome to the Laptop Monitor Toggle repository! This is a lightweight and easy-to-use application that adds a nifty feature for laptop users who also use a secondary monitor.

🔹 Purpose: Sometimes you just don't want your laptop monitor on while you're working on a secondary monitor. Sure, there's win+p+enter, but wouldn't it be better with a single button click? That's exactly what this app does. With the click of a designated button, toggle your laptop monitor on or off seamlessly.

🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹That looks fancy up there though lmaoooo

ok so remember to compile this code (which is writter in C++ lol) with this command "g++ changescreen.cpp -o changescreen.exe -mwindows"

for easy compile after you edited the code you just open a CMD there and run the command above and then you have an .exe file 
this exe file can be triggered by any button you have set-up for example if you have a drawing tablet and it has buttons
they usually have an app that let's you cosomize those buttons and run .exe files link that to the exe file you get when you compile
