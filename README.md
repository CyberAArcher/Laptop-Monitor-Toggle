That looks fancy up there though lmaoooo
.
ok so remember to compile this code (which is writter in C++ lol) with this command "g++ changescreen.cpp -o changescreen.exe -mwindows"
.

for easy compile after you edited the code you just open a CMD there and run the command above and then you have an .exe file 
this exe file can be triggered by any button you have set-up for example if you have a drawing tablet and it has buttons
they usually have an app that let's you cosomize those buttons and run .exe files link that to the exe file you get when you compile

now go a head and write a hate comment that this was assuming you were an idiot (it wasn't lmao you can' be dumber than me)
